We have a graph in which the set of nodes V = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7} and the set of edges 
E = {(0,6),(0,7),(1,6),(1,7),(2,6),(2,7),(3,5),(3,6),(3,7),(4,5),(4,6),(4,7),(5,6),(5,7),(6,7)}. 
Can you help me to draw this graph on the plane in a very nice way.

(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
{(0,6),(0,7),(1,6),(1,7),(2,6),(2,7),(3,5),(3,6),(3,7),(4,5),(4,6),(4,7),(5,6),(5,7),(6,7)}
